# pcPodcasts

### What is this for?
I use my phone primarily for music/podcast consumption but wanted to reduce the, quite frankly unhealthy, amount of time spent on it. Therefore, I want to shift to using my computer. Yeah, it's still a screen but it's where I tend to be more productive at least. Anyway, there are already plenty of rss readers/podcast programs out there already, but I've chosen to make my own. Starting from scratch serves two purposes. First off, I can grow as a programmer with good 'ol python scripting practice but also by learning how RSS works. More importantly though, I can completely customize the functionality I want rather than make compromises. For instance, I can easily integrate all audio I want (ie. Spotify doesn't have premium Patreon podcasts) and can easily track/analyze any of my listening habit stats I want.

### Current functionality:
- Takes in hard-coded rss url
- Downloads all new/un-downloaded episodes

### Future functionality:
- Handling multiple rss feeds
- Adding episode meta-data
- Phone synchronization
- Listening stats tracking/analysis
- Processing non-rss feeds (ie. long youtube video essays)

### Technical requirements:
-   Python 3
-   Installed requests, os, beautifulsoup4

### Usage:
   Run pcPodcasts.py!
